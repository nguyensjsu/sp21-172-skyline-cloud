For week 3, the implementation of all views of the online store is finished. What's left is to modify the controller to have the new card be added into database, would not be hard to implement. For next week, we will discuss how to connect the online store and the order application, and how to have the db set up for data query.

I'm currently working on the online store application.

## 2 Accomplishment

For week 4, I have implemented the request mapping controller method for each pages. I have also added a service class which using the @service annotation to hold the business logic to be used in service layer only. I have also improved the web pages on showing the cards, rewards, and balance in a table. What have to be done before submiting the application is to connect it with the order application and to have the kong api gateway working.
